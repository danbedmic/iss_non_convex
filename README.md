# About

This code can be used to reproduce the numerical experiments from the paper [Inverse Scale Space Iterations for Non-Convex Variational Problems: The Continuous and Discrete Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10865).

In order to reproduce our numerical experiments 
- Install the following two repositories:
	- https://github.com/tum-vision/prost
	- https://github.com/tum-vision/sublabel_relax/cvpr2016
- Run ``matlab/main.m``.

In order to look at our results run either ``results/visualize_ROF.m`` or ``results/visualize_stereo.m``.
